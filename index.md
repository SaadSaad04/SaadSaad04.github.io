### CPSC 120
* Lab 06 
Lab 06 was interesting to me because it was the first time we learned how to get a number between one and one hundred. We programmed it where if the command was to quit, it would be game over. Or if the command was less than one or greater than one hundred, it would be out of range. 
* lab 05
In lab 05 we learned the way people play black jack. The whole lab was practically about black jack and the rules of how other people play it. Some people might say that coding it showed them a different perspective on the game black jack.
* lab 07
In lab 07 black jack made a return, however this time it was a little different. In laab 07 we learned how to write inside functions. So if someone else says that they dont know how black jack works, this code explains how the game is played by some people.
